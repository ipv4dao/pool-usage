# pool_usage
This is the first attempt to organize the vote on IPv4DAO address pool usage.

The idea behind is that each holder of Root Token can express his view on IP address pool assignement.

Each token gives his owner a voting power of 100, which should be distributed between 4 types of pool assignements.

For example you may want to assign 80 to growth/monetisation, 10 for grants, 5 for internal use by DAO members and set 5 for liquidation.

There is no limit on vote frequency, so any holder can change his mind whenever he wants.

The "results" struct shows the sum of all members' settings.

If the member has 5 tokens, his bet is multiplied by 5.

From this struct we can extract the community's preferences on pool resource assignment, which serves as a guide for the teams responsible for pool allocation.
